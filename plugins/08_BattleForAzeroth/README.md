## Assault Zones: Uldum and Vale of the Eternal Blossoms

N'Zoths forces are assaulting Uldum and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. This addon aims to display everything you need while adventuring in these zones.

Unlocking the new assaults involves a introductory quest line. Once you have accepted "A Titanic Problem", you can check for large quest icons in both zones to track your progress towards unlocking assaults there.

## Rare Mobs

Rare mobs are listed as skulls on your map. If the skull is blue colored, that means you still need a collectible reward from that rare. If the rare has multiple spawn points, shares a spawn with common mobs or has a path, hovering over the skull will indicate all the points of interest or paths. Left-clicking on the skull will stick the points of interested on the map and minimap as you fly around.

All nodes in the addon can be individually hidden or sent to TomTom to create a waypoint.

## Assault Events

Every day, six different daily events will appear in Uldum and Vale. These locations will be marked on your map with yellow pins describing how to complete the event.

## Assault Caches and Locked Coffers

Each assault comes with caches scattered throughout the zone that offer extra Coalescing Visions each day. There are 5-6 different caches for each assault, and each cache has multiple spawn locations but can only be looted once a day.

To help visualize this, each individual cache is displayed with a different color. A group of caches on the map of the same color are all the possible spawn locations for that cache. Once you loot it, all the locations will disappear for the day.

Each assault also has a locked coffer associated with it. These required a key constructed from items dropped in the zone and give a larger amount of Coalescing Visions. They are shown on the map with a spiked chest icon.

## Battle Pets and Trainers

The locations of the eight new pet battles are displayed on the map, four in each zone.
