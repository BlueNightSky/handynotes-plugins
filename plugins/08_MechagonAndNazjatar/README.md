A [HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes "HandyNotes") plugin for the Mechagon and Nazjatar zones added in 8.2. This addon is based on the excellent [Argus](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes_argus "Argus") and [Warfronts](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-warfrontrares "Warfronts") plugins. It will add the locations and rewards for rare mobs, battle pets, treasures and other miscellaneous points of interest to the map.

### Mechagon

* Rares listed as colored skulls. A blue skull means you still need a reward from it.
* Pet battle locations.
* Mechanized chest locations (off by default).
* Locked chest location in the Western Spray for the keys that drop in the area.
* Reclamation Rig position and rewards.

### Nazjatar

* Rares listed as colored skulls. A blue skull means you still need a reward from it.
* Pet battle locations.
* Chest locations for the Trove Tracker achievement.
* War supply drop locations.
* Ravenous slime locations. Icons disappear as you feed them.
* Cat Figurine locations for the Feline Figurines Found achievement.
* Murloco and Mardivas' Laboratory.

IMPORTANT: Due to rares and treasures not being available until after certain intro quests are completed, all nodes are hidden until the final intro quest unlocking world quests is turned in. If you do not see nodes in Nazjatar, check for a large quest icon on the left side of the map. Hovering over it will give you an indicator of how many more quests need to be completed.

### Options
* Filter by node type (rares, treasures, battle pets)
* Scale icon sizes and alpha by type.
* Show only the rares you still need rewards from.

### Integrations
* If [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom) is installed, waypoints to nodes can be created in the right-click menu.

### Appearances
For rares that drop appearances, the rare will appear blue if one or more of your class specializations can loot the item and equip it. If those requirements are not met, the rare will show as white and you will see one of the two following statuses for the item:

* Unobtainable - Your class can equip the item, but it cannot drop for you.
* Unlearnable - Your class cannot equip the item.
